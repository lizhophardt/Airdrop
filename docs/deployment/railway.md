```

## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Your Repository

Ensure your repository has:
- `package.json` with build scripts
- `Dockerfile` (optional, Railway auto-detects Node.js)
- Environment variables configured

### 2. Connect to Railway

1. Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up/login with GitHub
3. Click "New Project"
4. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
5. Choose your repository

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

In Railway dashboard:
1. Go to your project
2. Click "Variables" tab
3. Add all required environment variables
4. Click "Add Variable" for each one

### 4. Deploy

Railway will automatically:
- Detect Node.js project
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run build`
- Start with `npm start`

## ðŸ”’ Security Best Practices

### Private Key Security

**Option 1: Encrypted Private Key (Recommended)**
```bash
# Generate encrypted key locally
npm run encrypt-key
# Use the output for ENCRYPTED_PRIVATE_KEY and ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD
```

**Option 2: Railway Environment Variables**
- Never commit private keys to git
- Use Railway's secure environment variables
- Consider rotating keys regularly

### Network Security

- Railway provides HTTPS by default
- Your service will be available at `https://your-app.up.railway.app`
- Configure CORS for your frontend domain

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring

### Railway Dashboard

Monitor your deployment:
- **Deployments**: View build and deployment logs
- **Metrics**: CPU, memory, and network usage
- **Logs**: Real-time application logs
- **Variables**: Manage environment variables

### Application Logs

Access logs through:
```bash
# Railway CLI
railway logs

# Or in Railway dashboard under "Logs" tab
```

## ðŸ”§ Custom Domain

### Setup Custom Domain

1. In Railway dashboard, go to "Settings"
2. Click "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain
4. Configure DNS records as shown
5. Railway provides automatic SSL certificates

### DNS Configuration

Add these records to your domain:
```
CNAME: your-domain.com -> your-app.up.railway.app
```

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Failures:**
```bash
# Check build logs in Railway dashboard
# Ensure all dependencies are in package.json
# Verify Node.js version compatibility
```

**Environment Variable Issues:**
- Double-check variable names (case-sensitive)
- Ensure no extra spaces in values
- Verify private key format (no 0x prefix)

**Connection Issues:**
- Check GNOSIS_RPC_URL is accessible
- Verify wallet has sufficient balance
- Ensure token address is correct

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# View logs
railway logs

# Connect to your project
railway link

# Run commands in Railway environment
railway run npm run status
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Scaling

### Auto-scaling

Railway automatically scales based on:
- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Request volume

### Resource Limits

Default limits:
- **Memory**: 512MB (upgradeable)
- **CPU**: Shared (upgradeable to dedicated)
- **Storage**: 1GB (upgradeable)

### Performance Optimization

```javascript
// In your app, add health checks
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ status: 'healthy', timestamp: new Date().toISOString() });
});
```

## ðŸ’° Pricing

Railway pricing tiers:
- **Hobby**: $5/month (512MB RAM, shared CPU)
- **Pro**: $20/month (8GB RAM, dedicated CPU)
- **Team**: Custom pricing

## ðŸ”„ Updates and Deployments

### Automatic Deployments

Railway automatically deploys when you:
- Push to main branch
- Update environment variables
- Manual redeploy from dashboard

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# Using Railway CLI
railway up

# Or redeploy from dashboard
```

### Rollback

In Railway dashboard:
1. Go to "Deployments"
2. Find previous successful deployment
3. Click "Redeploy"
