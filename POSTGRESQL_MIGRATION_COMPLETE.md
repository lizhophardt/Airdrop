   - Created mock database service for testing
   - Updated all tests to work with database
   - Added comprehensive test coverage

7. **Documentation**
   - Updated deployment guides
   - Created migration documentation
   - Added database schema documentation

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Local Development

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Database**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Docker Compose (recommended)
   docker-compose up -d postgres
   
   # Option 2: Local PostgreSQL
   # Install PostgreSQL and create database
   createdb cfp_funding_tool
   ```

3. **Configure Environment**
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your database and blockchain settings
   ```

4. **Migrate Secret Codes**
   ```bash
   # Set SECRET_CODES in .env for initial migration
   npm run migrate-codes
   ```

5. **Start Application**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Production Deployment (Railway)

1. **Add PostgreSQL to Railway Project**
   - Go to Railway dashboard
   - Add PostgreSQL service
   - Copy DATABASE_URL

2. **Set Environment Variables**
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key
   GNOSIS_RPC_URL=https://rpc.gnosischain.com
   WXHOPR_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0xD4fdec44DB9D44B8f2b6d529620f9C0C7066A2c1
   AIRDROP_AMOUNT_WEI=10000000000000000
   XDAI_AIRDROP_AMOUNT_WEI=10000000000000000
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

3. **Deploy Application**
   - Railway will automatically build and deploy
   - Database migrations run automatically on startup

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Tables

**secret_codes**
- Stores all secret codes with usage limits
- Tracks creation, updates, and active status
- Supports both limited and unlimited use codes

**code_usage**
- Complete audit trail of all code usage attempts
- Records transaction hashes, amounts, and metadata
- Tracks IP addresses and user agents for security
- Stores success/failure status with error details

### Key Features

- **Usage Limits**: Configurable per code (1 use, multiple uses, or unlimited)
- **Recipient Tracking**: Prevents same address from claiming multiple times
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all attempts (successful and failed)
- **Security Logging**: IP addresses, user agents, and metadata
- **Performance**: Optimized indexes for fast lookups

## üîß Management Commands

### Database Operations
```bash
# Setup local database
npm run db:setup

# Run migrations manually
npm run db:migrate

# Migrate secret codes
npm run migrate-codes
```

### Development
```bash
# Start with hot reload
npm run dev:watch

# Run tests
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build
npm start
```

## üìä Benefits Achieved

### ‚úÖ Scalability
- No file system bottlenecks
- Handles concurrent requests safely
- Supports thousands of codes and users

### ‚úÖ Reliability
- Persistent state (survives restarts)
- ACID transactions
- Connection pooling and error recovery

### ‚úÖ Security
- Prevents code reuse
- Tracks recipient addresses
- Complete audit trail
- Encrypted connections in production

### ‚úÖ Observability
- Usage statistics and analytics
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking and debugging

### ‚úÖ Maintainability
- Standard database operations
- Easy backup and restore
- Clear data model and relationships

## üö® Important Notes for Railway Users

### Environment Variables to Update

If you're using Railway, you need to update these environment variables:

1. **Add PostgreSQL Service** first (creates `DATABASE_URL`)
2. **Update** `DATABASE_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}`
3. **Remove** `SECRET_CODES` (now managed in database)
4. **Keep** all other existing variables

### Migration Process

The system will automatically migrate any `SECRET_CODES` from environment variables to the database on first startup. After successful migration, you can remove the `SECRET_CODES` environment variable.

## üîç Verification

After deployment, verify the migration worked:

1. **Health Check**: `GET /api/airdrop/health`
   - Should show `database: { isHealthy: true }`

2. **Service Status**: `GET /api/airdrop/status`
   - Should show `databaseHealth: true`
   - Should show `processedCount` from database

3. **Test Claim**: Try claiming with a valid secret code
   - Should work normally
   - Usage should be recorded in database
