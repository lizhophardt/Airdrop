- **Removed code duplication** in config management

### 5. 📝 **TypeScript Types Improvement** ✅
- **Added comprehensive type definitions**
- **Created security, Web3, and logging types**
- **Improved type safety** throughout the application
- **Consolidated types** in src/types/index.ts

### 6. 🛠️ **Error Handling Standardization** ✅
- **Standardized error patterns** across controllers and services
- **Improved error logging** with structured data
- **Consistent error response formats**
- **Better error context** for debugging

### 7. 🛡️ **Security Middleware Optimization** ✅
- **Combined security and metrics middleware** for efficiency
- **Added request tracking** with unique IDs
- **Maintained all security features** while reducing redundancy
- **Optimized middleware stack** order

### 8. 🧪 **Test Structure Organization** ✅
- **Added test index file** for better organization
- **Created test utilities and constants**
- **Verified no empty directories** or files
- **Improved test discoverability**

### 9. 📦 **Package Dependencies Cleanup** ✅
